# Purpur Packs
These are features that fit the "Purpur" theme, or have been requested for Purpur, but work better as a datapack.

What determines if something should be a datapack is if the feature is data-driven. You can kinda look through repos like [misode's mcmeta](https://github.com/misode/mcmeta/tree/summary) or use a tool to decompile minecraft yourself to see what is data-driven. 
There's a folder in the first directory, named `data` - everything in that directory is modifiable by datapacks.
